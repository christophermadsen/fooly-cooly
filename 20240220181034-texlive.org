#+title: texlive / markdown to pdf
#+filetags: :windows:markdown:pandoc:pdf:latex:tex:

With /Pandoc/ and /Texlive/ installed, Pandoc can convert to some really nice
looking PDF files. On Windows we'll need to install them manually. Using
chocolatey, the package manager for Windows, is just a really-really nice way
to do it:

: Pandoc
#+begin_example powershell
choco install pandoc
#+end_example

: Texlive
#+begin_example powershell
choco install texlive
#+end_example

To convert a document to PDF with pandoc we can do:
#+begin_example powershell
pandoc path-to-my-file.md -o path-to-my-out-file.pdf
#+end_example

We may encounter missing dependencies, but we can likely just install these
with chocolatey and make sure they are on our PATH, or we can use the built-in
Tex packagemanager =tlmgr= that comes with /Texlive/ in the case of missing tex
dependencies. I for example got the following error when trying to export a
Markdown file to PDF:
#+begin_example
Error producing PDF.
! LaTeX Error: File `xcolor.sty' not found.
#+end_example

I just fixed this by running:
#+begin_example powershell
tlmgr install xcolor
#+end_example
