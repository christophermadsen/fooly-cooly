If we don't use =ipython= source blocks in org, but use base python source
blocks, for example because we override the base python with jupyter kernels,
then we need to add a fix provided by jkitchin in a github issue:
https://github.com/jkitchin/ox-ipynb/issues/13

* ox-gfm and notedown
First use [[https://github.com/larstvei/ox-gfm][ox-gfm]] to export the org-mdoe file to a github-flavoured markdown
(GFM), then export that GFM file to a Jupyter Notebook with [[https://pypi.org/project/notedown/][notedown]]. It works
like a charm and produces beautiful results.
