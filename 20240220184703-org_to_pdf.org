#+title: org to pdf
#+filetags: :org:file:pandoc:convert:pdf:org-mode:

=Pandoc= is a really cool tool to use for converting files to other
types. Together with =Texlive= it really works wonders. Have a look at [[id:80e916a6-7310-4153-9a44-7ce6f4a53388][texlive]]
for installing the packages with =chocolatey=.

A basic call to Pandoc on the CLI, for making a nice looking PDF (not tested
with images) from an org file is the following:
#+begin_example powershell
pandoc -f org --toc -t pdf path-to-your-in.org -o path-to-your-out.pdf -V 'fontfamily:Nunito' -V 'geometry:margin=1in'
#+end_example

Using the ~-V~ argument signifies a /variable/, so in this call I define a
fontfamily and the size of the margin. When you run it it probably will tell
you Tex dependencies or fonts are missing. Install these with tex package
manager included in Texlive, =tlmgr=, when the error appears, and run the call
again.
