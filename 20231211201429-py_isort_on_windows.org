The Emacs package 'py-isort' on MELPA is pretty useful for automatically
sorting and cleaning up python imports.
https://melpa.org/#/py-isort

Within the .el file they provide there is a call to the 'diff' command. This
isn't available on Windows, so we can simply change the call to "diff" to "FC"
instead, which is the Windows equivalent. Open the py-isort.el file and do
this.
