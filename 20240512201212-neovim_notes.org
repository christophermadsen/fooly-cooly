#+title: Neovim - Notes


I've been experimenting with Neovim on Windows. Neovim seems to have a younger
and fresher community than Emacs and for this reason I decided to give Neovim a
try to see what this Vim vs Emacs war is all about anyways.

* Installation
This was really easy using [[https://scoop.sh/][scoop]] with:
#+begin_example powershell
scoop install neovim
#+end_example

And because my goal has been to use either the [[https://www.lazyvim.org/][Lazyvim distro]] of Neovim or the
[[https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim][kickstart.nvim]] config (Kickstart uses [[https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim][lazy.nvim]], Lazyvim's package manager), I
followed Kickstart's installation recipe and did:
#+begin_example powershell
scoop install neovim git ripgrep wget fd unzip gzip mingw make
#+end_example

* Configuration
** Encoding
Running ~:checkhealth~ in Neovim showed that I had an error with my locale. I
was able to fix that by ticking the =Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide
language support= box in Control Panel > Clock and Region > Administrative >
Change system locale...
